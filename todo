no url-encoded strings for PII!

replace the concept of realm.site_id with domain to be more LDAPy

add passwords

spit jinja2 templates back using API instead of files so CLI can be run anywhere

add validation for domains

rewrite sudoers mapping now that we don't have any servers in the DB. maybe. maybe rethink it

autoremove users from groups upon user removal

add copy feature for uadd and gadd, distinct from clone

pull over LDAP output module, integrate into main functionality

NOTE: LOOK FOR "DONE TO HERE"
