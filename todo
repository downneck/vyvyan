replace the concept of realm.site_id with domain to be more LDAPy

add password validation rules

add validation for domains

rewrite sudoers mapping now that we don't have any servers in the DB. maybe. maybe rethink it

pull over LDAP output module, integrate into main functionality

NOTE: LOOK FOR "DONE TO HERE"
